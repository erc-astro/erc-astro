My name is Eric Coughlin, and I'm currently an assistant professor in the physics department at 
Syracuse University. A lot of the coding I do is in Mathematica (aka Python++), and I will host
public/digestible notebooks that are produced as a byproduct of my research here, should anyone
want to use them for their own research.
